# Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
